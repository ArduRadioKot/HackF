# HackF
## Introduction
HackF is a small assistant for amateur radio programmers. It will contain all kinds of tools from a Wi-Fi jammer to an oscilloscope.
The project was inspired by M5stics and Flipper Zero.

Also, as part of the project, I developed 3D models of the case for the minimum configuration of the device.
The device is based on the milk-in duo board.
## Used components: 
*milk-in the duo
*240-by-240-point TFT display
This is at the time of the current device configuration
